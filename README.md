# Software_Engineering_Projects
* Warren Liu
* CIS 322: Introduction to Software Engineering
* Each project's folder contains each one's description

## Goals of this course are:

* to learn how a particular class of distributed system works (a web application, with a server side and a client side), and more generally how we construct overall systems;â€¢to build software that is divided into components written in different programming languages;
* to use a persistent database store for some of the data;
* to write Application Program Interfaces (APIs) to interface with them, and you will make small experiments to explore those APIs and test your understanding;
* to write documentation of your own code and design adequate for other programmers to use, maintain, and extend your software;
* to learn to manage versions and deployment of your evolving system using a distributed version control system.
